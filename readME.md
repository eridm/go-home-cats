Facing a tough burnout as an aspiring programmer, or like others who have been in a rut for quite a while, it pays a lot to rest and to do some restructuring in life. <br> 

This simple project is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript animations wherein the user just have to scroll down to let my emotional support friends named Comet, Brutus, and Juswa get home, as they are a tad bit of adventurers. <br>

Just as how life can be too unforgiving sometimes, especially for those who have other factors in life to consider, such as one's mental health, may it be a reminder that just trying again, albeit in a slow and steady pace, you'll be able to power through, because we are built for it. Hang in there, friend. <br>

...and really, my cats need to get home because it's dinner time here.
